# Modern Hotel Network Design

## Project Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a robust and secure network for Vic Modern Hotel, a three-floor facility with multiple departments. The network was meticulously created using Cisco Packet Tracer, adhering to best practices in network design and configuration.

## Key Features

- **Hierarchical Network Design**: Implemented a scalable and efficient network architecture for a three-floor hotel.
- **VLAN Segmentation**: Configured VLANs for 8 departments across different floors, enhancing security and network performance.
- **Dynamic IP Allocation**: Set up DHCP on each router, ensuring automated and efficient IP address management.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Utilized OSPF as the routing protocol to enable seamless communication between VLANs.
- **Secure Remote Access**: Configured SSH on all routers for secure and encrypted remote management.
- **Port Security**: Implemented sticky MAC address security with shutdown violation mode to protect critical network ports.
- **Wireless and Wired Connectivity**: Established reliable WLAN and wired connections for over 50 devices, including laptops, mobile devices, and printers.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Conducted extensive testing to ensure 99.9% network uptime and reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**
- **VLANs and Subnetting**
- **DHCP Server Configuration**
- **OSPF Routing Protocol**
- **SSH Configuration**
- **Port Security (Sticky MAC)**
- **Wireless LAN (WLAN) Configuration**


This project demonstrates the application of advanced networking principles to design a secure, efficient, and scalable network for a multi-floor hotel. The network is optimized for high availability and security, making it a reliable infrastructure for all hotel operations.
